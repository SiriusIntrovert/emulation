Thanks to the efforts of GhostlyDark (who primarily maintains the texture pack) OoT Reloaded and MM Reloaded are available for the Dolphin emulator. So what are OoT Reloaded and MM Reloaded? It is an unified ultra high definition texture pack designed for Dolphin (through the Virtual Console and the GameCube discs), GlideN64 (for use on Nintendo 64 emulators such as Project64) and the unofficial PC Port (SoH). Just about everything should be covered for the international version, including some mods here and there. The aim is to make the texture pack look as vanilla-like as possible.

This pack was previously known as Zelda 64 UHD but has now been superseded nu OoT & MM Reloaded? Why? Because Reloaded unified the texture pack for all platforms. A huge shoutout to masterotaku who originally started the project by porting the textures from Zelda Ocarina of Time Community Retexture Project from the N64 to the GC. And a huge shoutout to Nerrel (with his permission) who made the MMN64HD texture pack for Majora's Mask.

Other than just covering both games on all platforms it also covers all the content that is available through the Patcher64+ Tool: https://github.com/Admentus64/Patcher64P...l/releases, including new difficulty content, custom models, ROM hacks, languages, Redux and much more.

The Zelda 64 UHD or Zelda 64 4K project, respectively known for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Titles which have been released for the Nintendo 64 and have been re-released on the Nintendo GameCube as part of The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Master Quest (where the later also included The Legend of Zelda: Master Quest, a remixed version of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time with harder dungeons).

The texture project has been ongoing for quite some time, first being started by masterotaku who ported the Zelda Ocarina of Time Community Retexture Project from the N64 to the GC. On that has been said and done, Majora's Mask couldn't be ignored and followed afterwards.

In the current state of the project, everything has been re-textured, through it is still ongoing. Why? Because with the permission of Nerrel (who is amazingly talented) all of Majora's Mask is being reworked into a proper 4K state.

- Both the PNG and DDS BC7 pack are uploaded in 4k and 1080p formats.
- The DDS pack supports BC7.
- Both packs are packed in the 7-zip format. You might need to download 7-zip to unpack them. Newer versions of WinRAR should work too.
- The project is still ongoing for now with 29.988 textures drawn and ported.
- Supported Zelda 64 games: Collector's Edition Disc (OoT & MM), Master Quest Disc (OoT & MQ), Virtual Console (OoT & MM).
- Supported Zelda 64 regions: PAL (Europe), NTSC-U (United States) and NTSC-J (Japanese)

- Use the Patcher64+ Tool and an US VC version for OoT or MM to run any of the supported languages. Yes, you can even patch in the PAL languages into the US version.
- Prefetching the DDS BC7 pack requires 6.9 GB RAM for Ocarina of Time 9.4 GB RAM for Majora's Mask. Running PAL, NTSC-J or ROM Hacks requires more.


## Known Issues

- The 30 FPS code causes issues in specific scenario's. Use the code's toggle button to switch back to 20 FPS and retry. More issues are being fixed over time.
- The 16:9 Aspect Ratio Fix codes have the HUD centered, and not aligned to the edges of the screen.
- The Virtual Console versions only have a simplified 16:9 AR Widescreen fix through the Patcher64+ Tool.
- The 16:9 Widescreen codes have several issues (stretched backgrounds in OoT, dungeon map in MM)
- AR & Gecko Codes are only maintained for the NTSC-U versions. PAL is very much incomplete and NTSC-J is non-existent.
- Patching Redux requires the Wii VC WAD to be patched with the 8MB Expansion Pak. The Patcher64+ Tool can do this.

Patcher64+ Tool (Modding & Enhancements)  <br>
https://github.com/Admentus64/Patcher64P...l/releases


## Shader File:

A shader file can be downloaded and used to crop out the black borders for Ocarina of Time on the Wii's Virtual Console with Dolphin. 
Download the "zoom.glsl" shader file from our Discord or Google Drive links.
Put the file into (on Windows): "My Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Shaders\zoom.glsl" (use respective folders for Linux and Mac)
Open the graphical enhancements window in Dolphin, go to the Enhancements tab and then select the 'Zoom' filter from 'Post-Processing Effect'.


## Dolphin Info
DDS BC7 is supported since Dolphin 5.0-4894
Reduced RAM usage for DDS packs is supported since Dolphin 5.0-3506.
Allowing a texture pack to have any name and to load for multiple GameID versions is supported since Dolphin 5.0-11744
Compatible Wildcard symbols for Windows systems which are utilized for the Hyrule Skyboxes is supported since Dolphin 5.0-11744


## Installation Instructions
Download the latest DDS BC7 or PNG pack. It is recommended to use the DDS pack which is much faster.
Download the latest official development or Ishiiruka build. Dolphin 5.0 and builds prior to that will not support DDS BC7, reduced RAM usage for DDS packs and other various features.
Place the texture pack folder (works for every official game region) in "C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures".
Enable "Load Custom Textures" in Dolphin (Graphics -> Advanced -> Utility).
Enable "Prefetch Custom Textures" in Dolphin to load all textures at once to reduce stuttering. This option requires a fair bit amount of RAM, 12+ GB should be enough.
Disable "Crop" if having issues going fullscreen (Graphics -> Advanced -> Misc).
Download the Patcher64+ Tool if you're using the Wii VC version for enhanced quality options
