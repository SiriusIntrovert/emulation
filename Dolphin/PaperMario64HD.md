**Special Instructions:**
<br>
_**Requirements & Recommendations (Please Read):**_
<br>
* Use a recent development version of dolphin
* Enable "Load Custom Textures" & "Prefetch Custom Textures" in Dolphin (Graphics -> Advanced)
* I HIGHLY recommend using some kind of Anti-Aliasing (ideally SSAA, but if your system can't handle that use FXAA). Textures WILL look jagged otherwise. This is because Paper Mario 64 textures most of time can only utilize a binary alpha-channel (i.e. a pixel is either completly solid or transparent with no in-between)
* Enable CPU-clock-override (Config -> Advanced) and set it to a high value to reduce stuttering (I used 250%, only works if your system has enough performance)
* To "remove" the black borders around the screen check out the guide below
* It is also worth mentioning that the NTSC-U version runs at a higher Framerate than PAL (30FPS vs 25FPS)
